    <h1 id="1">Halo - Beyoncé</h1>
    <p><i><pre>
        Remember those walls I built
        Well, baby, they're tumbling down
        And they didn't even put up a fight
        They didn't even make a sound
        
        I found a way to let you win
        But I never really had a doubt
        Standing in the light of your halo
        I got my angel now
        
        It's like I've been awakened
        Every rule I had you break it
        It's the risk that I'm taking
        I ain't never gonna shut you out
        
        Everywhere I'm looking now
        I'm surrounded by your embrace
        Baby, I can see your halo
        You know you're my saving grace
        
        You're everything I need and more
        It's written all over your face
        Baby, I can feel your halo
        Pray it won't fade away
        
        I can feel your halo (halo) halo
        I can see your halo (halo) halo
        I can feel your halo (halo) halo
        I can see your halo (halo) halo
        
        Hit me like a ray of sun
        Burning through my darkest night
        You're the only one that I want
        Think I'm addicted to your light
        
        I swore I'd never fall again
        But this don't even feel like falling
        Gravity can't forget
        To pull me back to the ground again
        
        Feels like I've been awakened
        Every rule I had you break it
        The risk that I'm taking
        I'm never gonna shut you out
        
        Everywhere I'm looking now
        I'm surrounded by your embrace
        Baby, I can see your halo
        You know you're my saving grace
        
        You're everything I need and more
        It's written all over your face
        Baby, I can feel your halo
        Pray it won't fade away
        
        I can feel your halo (halo) halo
        I can see your halo (halo) halo
        I can feel your halo (halo) halo

        I can feel your halo (halo) halo
        I can see your halo (halo) halo
        Halo, halo
        
        Everywhere I'm looking now
        I'm surrounded by your embrace
        Baby, I can see your halo
        You know you're my saving grace

        I've been reading books of old
        The legends and the myths
        Achilles and his gold
        Hercules and his gifts
        Spiderman's control
        And Batman with his fists
        And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

        But she said, where'd you wanna go?
        How much you wanna risk?
        I'm not looking for somebody
        With some superhuman gifts
        Some superhero
        Some fairytale bliss
        Just something I can turn to
        Somebody I can kiss

        I want something just like this
        Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
        Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        Oh, I want something just like this
        Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
        Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

        Oh, I want something just like this
        I want something just like this

        I've been reading books of old
        The legends and the myths
        The testaments they told
        The moon and its eclipse
        And Superman unrolls
        A suit before he lifts
        But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

        She said, where'd you wanna go?
        How much you wanna risk?
        I'm not looking for somebody
        With some superhuman gifts
        Some superhero
        Some fairytale bliss
        Just something I can turn to
        Somebody I can miss

        I want something just like this
        I want something just like this

        Oh, I want something just like this
        Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

        I've been drunk three times this week
        Spent all my money on a fleeting moment
        I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
        Now I-I-I-I-I-I can't make this stop
        Yeah, things were sweet three months ago
        When I was living how I wanna on my own
        And I thought I-I-I-I-I-I don't need that much
        I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch

        I'm fucked up, I'm faded
        I'm so complicated
        Those things that I said
        They were so overrated
        But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
        Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

        Yeah, I meant it

        I gave up three times this week
        Went through those feelings
        Like I wasn't worth nothing
        I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
        No, I-I-I-I-I-I can't be this soft

        I'm fucked up, I'm faded
        I'm so complicated
        Those things that I said
        They were so overrated
        But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
        Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

        Yeah, I meant it

        I'm fucked up, I'm faded
        I'm so complicated
        Those things that I said
        They were so overrated
        But I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
        Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

        Yeah, I meant it
        Yeah, I meant it

        The club isn't the best place to find a lover
        So the bar is where I go
        Me and my friends at the table doing shots
        Drinking faster and then we talk slow
        Come over and start up a conversation with just me
        And trust me I'll give it a chance now
        Take my hand, stop
        Put Van The Man on the jukebox
        And then we start to dance
        And now I'm singing like

        Girl, you know I want your love
        Your love was handmade for somebody like me
        Come on now, follow my lead
        I may be crazy, don't mind me
        Say, boy, let's not talk too much
        Grab on my waist and put that body on me
        Come on now, follow my lead
        Come, come on now, follow my lead

        I'm in love with the shape of you
        We push and pull like a magnet do
        Although my heart is falling too
        I'm in love with your body
        And last night you were in my room
        And now my bedsheets smell like you
        Every day discovering something brand new
        I'm in love with your body
        Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
        I'm in love with your body
        Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
        I'm in love with your body
        Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
        I'm in love with your body
        Every day discovering something brand new
        I'm in love with the shape of you

        One week in we let the story begin
        We're going out on our first date
        You and me are thrifty
        So go all you can eat
        Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
        We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
        And how your family is doing okay
        Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
        Tell the driver make the radio play
        And I'm singing like

        Girl, you know I want your love
        Your love was handmade for somebody like me
        Come on now, follow my lead
        I may be crazy, don't mind me

        I had a dream
        We were sipping whiskey neat
        Highest floor, The Bowery
        Nowhere’s high enough
        Somewhere along the lines
        We stopped seeing eye to eye
        You were staying out all night
        And I had enough

        No, I don't wanna know
        Where you been or where you're goin'
        But I know I won't be home
        And you'll be on your own

        Who's gonna walk you
        Through the dark side of the morning?
        Who's gonna rock you
        When the sun won't let you sleep?
        Who's waking up to drive you home
        When you're drunk and all alone?
        Who's gonna walk you
        Through the dark side of the morning?

        It ain't me
        (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where you're going)
        It ain't me
        (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where you're going)
        It ain't me
        (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where you're going)
        It ain't me

        I had a dream
        We were back to seventeen
        Summer nights and the liberties
        Never growing up
        I'll take with me
        The polaroids and the memories
        But you know I'm gonna leave
        Behind the worst of us

        Who's gonna walk you
        Through the dark side of the morning?
        Who's gonna rock you
        When the sun won't let you sleep?
        Who's waking up to drive you home
        When you're drunk and all alone?
        Who's gonna walk you
        Through the dark side of the morning?

        It ain't me, no no
        It ain't me, no no
        It ain't me, no no
        It ain't me, no no
        Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
        It ain't me
        (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where you're going)
        It ain't me
        (The Bowery, whiskey neat, where you're going)
